Minh Dinh

Check your understanding:

1. I would put automated testing whenever someone attempts to merge code into the production branch. In other words, when a pull request into the production branch is opened or when new code is pushed to that pull request, then all the automated tests will run. However, I would also encourage people to run the tests in their local environment before pushing to the pull request to resolve testing issues beforehand.
2. No, you would use a unit test.
